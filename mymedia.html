        <p>My favorite movie is RRR."RRR" is an upcoming Indian Telugu-language period action drama film directed by S. S. Rajamouli. The film is set in the 1920s and follows the fictionalized story of Indian freedom fighters Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, who fought against the British Raj and the Nizam of Hyderabad, respectively. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, Alia Bhatt, and Ajay Devgn in prominent roles. "RRR" is highly anticipated due to the director's previous blockbuster successes and the star-studded cast.
